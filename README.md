# Python RPC Generator
Hey, welcome to one of my small project!
This project features cross language development using Python and .NET (C#).
I created this over the weekend because it just seemed cool to develop!

In short, this project allows you to generate very simple RPC client and servers. You can then use the generated code for any project that may need simple and not complex RPC servers.

The currently supported data types, are the basic data types such as: string, int, float and all of those.
If you actually want to develop this project, then let me know just so I'll get a little excited about this, and the fact that someone used / develops this project!

Best regard to yall ~FreeMotion45
